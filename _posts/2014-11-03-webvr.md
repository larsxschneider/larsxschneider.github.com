I spent the summer in San Francisco and on my last weekend I decided to geek out big way. I teamed up with [@t0rsten](https://twitter.com/t0rsten) to join the [San Francisco VR Hackathon](http://vrhackathon.com/). Our expectations were low and our primary motivation was to have some dedicated time to tinker with a new cool tech called WebVR.

To our big surprise, we actually won [1st prize in the web-based VR category](http://www.web3d.org/projects/vr-hackathon/fall-2014) with our photo gallery application "MedExplorer". A recording of our presentation is on YouTube:

The main challenge that we and most of the other WebVR teams faced was to get WebVR working at all. We literally spend 90% of the time to find a [working browser build](http://blog.tojicode.com/2014/07/bringing-vr-to-chrome.html) and figuring out how the [API works](http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/06/26/first-steps-for-vr-on-the-web/).

As announced in the presentation we want to help other developers to get up to speed faster and publish our [minimal demos on GitHub](https://github.com/larsxschneider/webvr-examples). 

The following demos are the first drop and heavily based on the great work of [Vladimir Vukićević](http://blog.bitops.com/) and [Brandon Jones](http://blog.tojicode.com/):
